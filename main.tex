\section{Cite references here, so they appear}

We suggest to start from these references for anomaly detection:
\begin{itemize}
\item A classic survey on anomaly detection~\cite{Chandola2009}.
\item A review of anomaly detection methods for categorical data~\cite{Thana2019}.
\item A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Anomaly Detection with Deep Learning~\cite{Ma2021}.
\item A review of anomaly detection and less-than-supervised methods in particle physics~\cite{Nachman:2020ccu}.
\item A review of deep learning applications for anomaly detection~\cite{Pang_2021}.
\item The summary of a data challenge on anomalous-jet events in particle physics~\cite{Kasieczka:2021xcg}.
\item The summary of a data challenge on anomalous events in particle physics~\cite{Aarrestad:2021oeb}.
\item A paper on using deep anomaly detection on FPGAs in real time~\cite{Govorkova:2021utb}.
\end{itemize}

We could expand this list, e.g., looking at the references of each of these papers.

For real-time analysis (turbo stream / data scouting / trigger-level analysis), you can look at these references: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Summary of ATLAS, CMS and LHCb uses up to 2018: \cite{Duarte:2018bsd}, also have a quick read of the original references for these papers; 
\item More recent LHCb paper detailing Run-2/3 infrastructure: \cite{Aaij:2019uij};
\item Additional CMS paper (data scouting with muons): \cite{CMS:2019buh};
\item ALICE O2 system summary: \cite{Rohr:2022xcs}. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Introduction}

Its always good to have an introduction, if only to have an example for a section. And here is an example for a reference from the bibtex file. Its also pretty easy to reference figures (see Figure \ref{fig:examplecernlogo}). \\
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/cernlogo.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:examplecernlogo} Example of how to include a figure. This works with all sorts of formats, eps, pdf, png.}
\end{figure}

% this will prevent float objects like figures to be moved past this point in the document.

You also have the option of using colored text, for example \color{blue} this part in blue,  \color{red} this part in red  \color{green} and this part in green, before \color{black} going back to black.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Everyone loves an enumerated list.
\item If you prefer bulleted lists, see below.
\end{enumerate}

Of course there are always use cases for list with enumerations, and lists with bullets only, which is why it is useful to have examples of both.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Everyone loves a bulleted list.
    \item If you prefer an enumerated list, see above.
\end{itemize}

\section{The first section after the introduction}
Since an example of a ToC is not much fun with only one section, lets make another one and throw in some subsections as well.


\subsection{The first sub-section}
How about structuring the document into more subsections.

\subsection{The second sub-section}
Tables are just as easy as figures to construct and reference, for example this one here (see Table \ref{tab:exampletable}).

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|p{0.1\textwidth}| } 
    \hline
    \rowcolor{lightgray} 
    col1 & col2 & col3 & col4\\
    \hline
    \multirow{3}{4em}{Multiple row} & cell2 & cell3 & cell4 \\ 
    \cline{3-4}
    & cell5 & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cell6 and cell7} \\
    \cline{3-4}
    & cell8 & cell9 & cell10 \\ 
    \hline
    cell11 & cell12 & cell13 & cell14 \\ 
    \hline
    \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{ Multicolumn} \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{A table is as happy about a caption as a fiugre.}
\label{tab:exampletable}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusions}
If the document purpose calls for conclusions, this would be the place to put them.
